# Business Problem: Flight Cancellations Prediction  

**Background:**
An airline company is facing challenges with flight cancellations, resulting in financial losses, customer dissatisfaction, and operational disruptions. Frequent cancellations lead to increased costs, loss of revenue, and a negative impact on the airline's reputation. The company aims to implement a proactive solution to predict and reduce the likelihood of flight cancellations.

**Objective:**
Develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts the probability of a flight being canceled based on historical data, enabling the airline to take preemptive measures to minimize cancellations and optimize its operations.

**Dataset:**
The dataset includes historical information on flights, airports, weather conditions, air traffic, and other relevant features. Key attributes include flight details (departure time, arrival time, airline, etc.), weather data, airport information, and any previous cancellation incidents.

**Challenges:**
1. **Imbalanced Classes:** The dataset is likely to have imbalanced classes, as flight cancellations are relatively rare compared to successful flights. Handling this class imbalance is crucial for model training and evaluation.

2. **Temporal Dynamics:** Flight cancellations may exhibit temporal patterns influenced by factors such as seasons, holidays, or specific days of the week. Capturing these temporal dynamics is essential for accurate predictions.

3. **Weather Dependency:** Weather conditions play a significant role in flight cancellations. Incorporating real-time weather data and understanding its impact on cancellations is vital.

4. **Operational Factors:** Factors such as airport congestion, air traffic control issues, and aircraft maintenance can contribute to cancellations. These operational aspects need to be considered for a comprehensive model.

**Expected Outcomes:**
1. A machine learning model capable of predicting the probability of flight cancellations for individual flights.
   
2. Insights into the most influential factors contributing to cancellations, allowing the airline to prioritize and address specific issues.

3. Proactive decision-making tools for airline staff to take preventive measures, such as rescheduling, notifying passengers in advance, and optimizing resource allocation.

4. Reduced financial losses, improved operational efficiency, and enhanced customer satisfaction by minimizing the impact of cancellations.

**Success Criteria:**
The machine learning model should achieve a high area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC) or precision-recall curve, indicating its ability to discriminate between canceled and non-canceled flights effectively. Additionally, the model should be interpretable, allowing stakeholders to understand the key features influencing cancellation predictions.
